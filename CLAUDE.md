# CW&T Wholesale App — Claude Code Reference

Custom Shopify B2B wholesale app. Replaces a paid third-party B2B app. Built with
Remix + TypeScript + Prisma + Shopify App Extensions.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: `@shopify/shopify-app-remix` v3 (Remix + TypeScript)
- **Admin UI**: Shopify Polaris v13 (fully controlled components — no `defaultValue`)
- **Database**: Prisma + SQLite (local dev) → switch provider to `postgresql` for Fly.io
- **Hosting**: Fly.io, region `ewr` (Newark), `shared-cpu-1x` 512 MB
- **Storefront**: Theme App Extensions only — never edit theme files directly
- **API version**: Shopify January 2025

## Local Development

Run dev with **`./dev-start.sh`** — it runs standard `shopify app dev`. The CLI manages **one**
cloudflare tunnel that serves both the embedded app and the extensions, and auto-updates
`application_url`, redirect URLs, and `[app_proxy].url` in the Partner Dashboard
(`automatically_update_urls_on_dev = true`). Wait for `✅ Ready, watching for changes`, then press
`p` to open the preview. No manual Partner-Dashboard URL editing is needed.

**cloudflared must be the Homebrew build, not the CLI's bundled one.** The bundled binary
(2024.8.2) is rejected by Cloudflare's edge (`Register tunnel error … "Unauthorized: Tunnel not
found"`) — the tunnel dies within the hour and the CLI freezes at "Preparing dev preview".
`dev-start.sh` forces the current binary via `SHOPIFY_CLI_CLOUDFLARED_PATH`. One-time prereq:
`brew install cloudflared`.

**Two config invariants — do NOT revert these (reverting either causes `Invalid path /`):**
- `shopify.web.toml` must include the **`frontend`** role (`roles = ["background", "frontend"]`).
  With `type = "backend"` the CLI proxy refuses to serve `/`.
- `vite.config.ts` `server.port` must be **`Number(process.env.PORT || 3000)`** (HMR derived from
  `SHOPIFY_APP_URL` / `FRONTEND_PORT`). Never hardcode `61733` / `strictPort` — the CLI assigns the
  frontend port and proxies to it; a hardcoded port makes the proxy forward nowhere → timeout.

**Do NOT reintroduce `dev-proxy.mjs` or `shopify app dev --tunnel-url`.** That was an abandoned
workaround for the stale-cloudflared problem; it is incompatible with standard dev and caused
multi-day freezes. `dev-proxy.mjs` is now dead code.

**iCloud sync caveat:** this repo lives under `~/Documents/CW&T`, covered by iCloud "Desktop &
Documents" sync. Sync periodically creates `" 2"` duplicate binaries inside `node_modules` (e.g.
`@esbuild/.../bin/esbuild 2`) and can corrupt the originals, breaking builds confusingly.
**Strongly consider moving the repo out of the synced folder** (or excluding `node_modules`).

### Troubleshooting "the dev server is broken"

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Frozen at "Preparing dev preview"; cloudflared log loops `Unauthorized: Tunnel not found` | Stale bundled cloudflared rejected by Cloudflare edge | `brew install cloudflared` (already wired via `SHOPIFY_CLI_CLOUDFLARED_PATH`); Ctrl+C and re-run `./dev-start.sh` |
| Preview page says `Invalid path /…` | `shopify.web.toml` not `frontend`, or `vite.config.ts` hardcodes the port | Restore the two invariants above; restart dev |
| An extension/function build hangs silently (proc alive, 0% CPU, no output) | A function's `[extensions.build].command` recursively re-invokes `shopify app function build`, deadlocking on `.build-lock` | Leave `command = ""` for JS functions — CLI 3.94 builds them natively (esbuild→Javy). Never point `command` at a script that calls `shopify app function build` |
| `Host version X does not match binary Y`, or weird esbuild failures | iCloud sync corrupted an esbuild binary | `find node_modules -name "* 2"`, then `npm ci`; move repo off iCloud |

## Build Status

- [x] Step 1: App scaffolded (Remix, TypeScript, Shopify CLI)
- [x] Step 2: Prisma schema (SQLite, 7 models), migrations run, db.server.ts
- [x] Step 3: `wholesale-customer.server.ts` middleware, login delay bug fix (3-layer)
- [x] Step 4: App Proxy route, Theme App Extension blocks + assets
- [x] Step 5: Out-of-stock / backorder (Draft Order API bypass)
- [x] Step 6: Cart validation (min cart value — Checkout UI Extension)
- [x] Step 7: HTML line sheet (client-side print CSS + html2pdf.js)
- [x] Step 8: Shipping rule (Shopify Functions Delivery Customization) — rebuilt 2026-06-23 as a
      modern JS function (`type = "function"`, target `cart.delivery-options.transform.run`),
      builds to `dist/function.wasm` via the native CLI 3.94 toolchain, 3 passing integration
      tests. Lives in `extensions/wholesale-free-shipping/`. See below.
- [ ] Step 9: CMS sync (GET /api/wholesale/variants/ endpoint on cms.cwandt.com)
- [ ] Step 10: Admin dashboard polish

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Login delay bug | 3-layer: `{% style %}` + `<meta name="wh-customer">` + sessionStorage | No async, no race condition |
| Backorder | Draft Order API bypass | Avoid `inventoryPolicy: CONTINUE` globally |
| Line sheet PDF | Client-side `@media print` + html2pdf.js | No server rendering needed |
| Shipping | Shopify Functions Delivery Customization | Always free US wholesale |
| Storefront UI | Theme App Extensions only | Shopify requirement, merchant-agnostic |

## Critical Constraints

- CMS repo (`github.com/cheewee2000/cwandt-cms`) — commits are allowed but scope is narrow: only add what is explicitly planned and reviewed before writing
- Do NOT connect to the live Shopify store (`cw-and-t.myshopify.com`) until explicitly told
- All storefront UI via Theme App Extensions only — no direct theme file edits
- The only planned CMS change: add one read-only endpoint (`GET /api/wholesale/variants/`)

```

## Checkout UI Extension (Step 6)

`extensions/wholesale-checkout/` — renders a warning block in the checkout if a wholesale
customer's cart is below the configured minimum order value.

**Customer detection**: reads the `wholesale.status` customer metafield set by the app
(namespace `"wholesale"`, key `"status"`, value `"approved"` or `"inactive"`). This metafield
is written by `app.applications.tsx` (on approve) and `app.customers.tsx` (on approve /
suspend / reject). The extension TOML declares the namespace/key so `useAppMetafields()` can
read it without a network call.

**Minimum value**: configured by the merchant in the Shopify checkout editor via an extension
setting (`minimum_order_value`). Must be kept in sync with the value in the app's Pricing Rules.

**Cannot block checkout**: Checkout UI Extensions are advisory only — they show warnings but
cannot prevent a customer from completing an order. For hard blocking, a Shopify Functions
Order Validation function would be needed (deferred).

**MOQ check**: structure is in place (commented out) and will activate when CMS sync (Step 9)
populates `moq` values on variant metafields.

**Important setup step**: The extension must be added to the checkout in Shopify Admin →
Settings → Checkout → Customize. Without adding the block, it renders nothing.

## Delivery Customization Function (Step 8)

> **REBUILT & ENABLED (2026-06-23).** Re-scaffolded with `shopify app generate extension
> --template delivery_customization --flavor typescript` on CLI **3.94.3**, which produces a
> modern JS function: `type = "function"`, target `cart.delivery-options.transform.run`, export
> `cart-delivery-options-transform-run`, `@shopify/shopify_function` v2, and an **empty**
> `[extensions.build].command = ""` so the CLI's native esbuild→Javy pipeline builds it (no more
> recursive `npm run build` deadlock). `npm run build` produces `dist/function.wasm`; `npm test`
> runs 3 vitest integration tests that build the wasm and validate I/O against the schema.
>
> The old parked copy (`_disabled_extensions/wholesale-shipping/`, old `delivery_customization`
> type with the recursive build) has been **deleted** — superseded by this one.

`extensions/wholesale-free-shipping/` — hides all shipping options that cost > $0 for approved
wholesale customers with a US shipping address. Non-wholesale buyers and non-US addresses
see normal shipping rates unaffected. Logic in `src/cart_delivery_options_transform_run.ts`;
input query in the sibling `.graphql`. US is checked per delivery group via
`deliveryAddress.countryCode === CountryCode.Us`.

**Customer detection**: reads the same `wholesale.status` customer metafield as the checkout
extension. Metafield is written on every approve/suspend/reject in `app.customers.tsx` and
`app.applications.tsx`.

**Auto-activation**: `shopify.server.ts` `afterAuth` calls `deliveryCustomizationCreate` on
OAuth completion. It checks for an existing record first to avoid duplicates, and no-ops
silently if the function isn't deployed yet (safe to call on every re-auth).

**REQUIRED SETUP — must do before testing:**
1. In Shopify Admin → Settings → Shipping and delivery → Manage rates: add a **$0 shipping
   rate** named "Wholesale Free Shipping" for the US zone. Without this rate, the function
   will hide ALL shipping options and the checkout will stall with no rates available.
2. Deploy the function so it exists in the store: `shopify app deploy` (or it builds + uploads
   during `shopify app dev`). On the next OAuth, `afterAuth` → `enableWholesaleShippingFunction`
   finds it by handle `wholesale-free-shipping` and creates the delivery customization record.
   (Build no longer needs any manual step — `dist/function.wasm` is produced natively by the CLI.)

**Scope of "free"**: US only. International wholesale orders see normal rates. If CW&T wants
free international wholesale shipping in the future, change the `isUS` check in `src/run.ts`.

## App Proxy

Shopify routes `https://cw-and-t.myshopify.com/apps/wholesale/*` → app server `/app-proxy/*`.
`logged_in_customer_id` in the query string is HMAC-signed by Shopify — safe to trust after
`authenticate.public.appProxy()` verifies the signature.

## Customer ID Format

`shopifyCustomerId` is stored as the **numeric string** (e.g. `"6789012345"` from `legacyResourceId`)
everywhere. When calling Admin GraphQL, construct the GID:
`gid://shopify/Customer/${customer.shopifyCustomerId}`

## SQLite → Postgres Migration

When deploying to Fly.io, change `schema.prisma` datasource provider to `"postgresql"` and
set `DATABASE_URL` to the Fly Postgres connection string. The String-based status fields work
in both databases. Run `prisma migrate deploy` in the Dockerfile (already configured).

## Honest Risk Assessment — What Will Break on First Real Store Connection

Reviewed 2026-05-12. Issues are ordered by likelihood of causing real problems.

### HIGH — Will definitely need attention

**1. `shopify.app.toml` placeholders not filled in**
Three placeholders must be replaced before `shopify app dev` works:
- `YOUR_CLIENT_ID_FROM_PARTNER_DASHBOARD`
- `YOUR_DEV_STORE.myshopify.com`
- `YOUR_APP_URL.fly.dev` (also in the `[app_proxy]` section)

Without these, OAuth will fail with cryptic errors.

**2. Theme CSS selectors may not match**
`wholesale-price.liquid` hides retail prices with:
```css
.price, .price__regular, .price__sale, .price--main,
.price-item--regular, .price-item--sale,
[class*="product__price"], [class*="ProductPrice"]
```
These cover Dawn (Shopify's default theme). If CW&T uses a custom theme with different class
names, retail prices will show through. Inspect the theme's price element classes and add
selectors to `wholesale-price.liquid` as needed.

**3. `wholesale-badge.liquid` must be added to the header**
The `<meta name="wh-customer">` tag that `wholesale.js` reads synchronously comes from this
block. If a merchant forgets to add it to their header section, `wholesale.js` will always
read content="" (absent meta = no tag) and treat everyone as non-wholesale. The price block
will never activate. This is the most operationally risky setup step.

**4. Webhook registration only runs on OAuth (`afterAuth`)**
Webhooks are registered in the `afterAuth` hook. If the app was installed before these webhooks
were added to `shopify.server.ts`, they won't be active until the merchant re-installs or
re-authorizes. During initial setup this is fine (OAuth flow runs), but worth knowing for
future webhook additions.

### MEDIUM — Functional gaps that will surface in testing

**5. `variant:change` event coverage**
`wholesale.js` listens for the `variant:change` custom event (dispatched by Dawn and some
other themes). Themes that don't dispatch this event will not update prices when the user
switches variants — the fallback `[name="id"]` change listener covers most cases, but
Ajax-driven variant selectors (without DOM form updates) won't trigger it.

**6. ~~Volume tier discount has no cap~~ — FIXED (2026-05-12)**
`applyVolumeTier` now loads `WholesaleSettings.maxDiscountPercent` (default 70%) and caps
the combined discount at that value via `Math.min`. Configurable in Settings → Pricing Policy.
Zod validation (`z.coerce.number().gt(0).max(100)`) on all discount and order minimum fields
in `app.pricing.tsx` and `app.settings.tsx` prevents nonsensical values from persisting.

**7. `qty` for volume tiers is per-product, not cart total**
The `qty` passed to the App Proxy comes from the product form quantity input.
Volume tier discounts therefore apply per-product quantity shown on the product page,
not the total cart quantity. Behavior may differ from what merchants expect.

**8. `CUSTOMERS_UPDATE` webhook auto-approves at default 40% discount**
`handleCustomerWebhook` in `webhooks.tsx` creates a `WholesaleCustomer` with
`status: "APPROVED"` and `discountPercent: 40` whenever a customer with the `wholesale`
tag is seen via webhook. This means manually tagging a customer in Shopify Admin bypasses
the application review flow and hardcodes 40% discount. Intentional, but the admin should
know this shortcut exists.

### LOW — Not bugs, but worth knowing

**9. Storefront API public access**
`authenticate.public.appProxy()` provides a Storefront API client that uses the shop's
public storefront token. Product prices are publicly accessible through the Storefront API —
this works without explicit Storefront API scopes. Should be fine out of the box.

**10. SQLite enum values are not DB-enforced**
Status fields (`"PENDING"`, `"APPROVED"`, etc.) are plain strings — SQLite does not enforce
valid values. A typo like `"APPOVED"` would persist silently. Consider adding Zod validation
at action boundaries before Step 10 polish.

### Bugs Fixed in Review (2026-05-12)

- **`app.customers.tsx` — tags replacement bug**: `customerUpdate` mutation was setting
  `tags: ["wholesale"]` which REPLACES all existing customer tags. Fixed to fetch existing
  tags first and append `"wholesale"` only if not already present.

- **`app.customers.tsx` — Select uncontrolled**: `onChange={() => {}}` caused the status
  Select to visually revert after every change, making the form unreliable. Fixed by
  extracting each row to a `CustomerRow` component with `useState(customer.status)` for
  per-row state.

## CMS Integration (Step 9)

CMS: Django app at `cms.cwandt.com` (DreamHost VPS: `cwandt@vps52023.dreamhostps.com`).
Repo: `github.com/cheewee2000/cwandt-cms` (private, READ ONLY).

CMS already has `apps/wholesale/` with `WholesaleVariant` model (wholesale_price,
distributor_price, moq, upc, status). The ONLY planned change to the CMS is adding:

```
GET /api/wholesale/variants/   (bearer token auth)
```

Wire via env vars: `CMS_BASE_URL` and `CMS_API_TOKEN` (already read in `cms-client.server.ts`).
Do not make any other CMS changes until explicitly instructed.
